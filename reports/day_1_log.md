# Day 1

## What I built
- Python-based log parser (keywords: unauthorized, failed, error)
- Tested on sample logs in `logs/example.log`
- Basic ML anomaly detection model with scikit-learn in Colab

## What I learned
- How important logs are and how to navigate them as a threat hunter
- How to parse logs line by line
- Why MITRE ATT@CK matters
- Basics of supervised ML and anomaly detection

## Big Takeways
- MITRE TTPS help organize and connect the dots
- Even a tiny ML model can help triage suspicious logs

## Next steps
- Add timestap parsing to the parser
- Start writing detection rules(Sigma)
- Explore more log sources(Windows + Linux)

## Reflection
" Taking the time to learn the skills and tools used to find cyber threats in logs, was really eye opening. Every log taught me the importance of what we are doing, to become better defenders.
